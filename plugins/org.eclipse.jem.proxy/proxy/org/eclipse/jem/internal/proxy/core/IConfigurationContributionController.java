	 * Add a file/folder from a plugin in the running Eclipse to the classpath. The type flag tells where to add it.
	 * In development mode it will find the bin class files instead if proxy.jars is setup correctly.
	 * <p>
	 * If nlsLocalize is <code>true</code>, then it will also search through the fragments in this manner:
	 * (Note: if <code>false</code> it will still search in the fragments, but it will only return the first file found that matches.
	 * <p>
	 * To find the files in the fragments that are in the runtime path (i.e. libraries), it will need to use a suffix,
	 * This is because the JDT will get confused if a runtime jar in a fragment has the same name
	 * as a runtime jar in the main plugin. So we will use the following search pattern:
	 * 
	 * 1) Find in the plugin and all of the fragments those that match the name exactly
	 * 2) Find in all of the fragments, in their runtime path (<library> stmt), those that match the name 
	 *    but have a suffix the same as the uniqueid of the fragment (preceeded by a period). This is so that it can be easily
	 *    found but yet be unique in the entire list of fragments. For example if looking for "runtime/xyz.jar"
	 *    and we have fragment "a.b.c.d.frag", then in the runtime path we will look for the file
	 *    "runtime/xyz.a.b.c.d.frag.jar".
	 * <p>
	 * If the files in the fragments are not in the fragments library path then it can have the same name as in the plugin.
	 * <p>
	 * This is useful for nls where the nls for the filename will be in one or more of the fragments of the plugin.	 	 
	 * 
	 * @param bundle The bundle it can be found in.
	 * @param relativePath Path to file/folder relative to bundle root. If it is <code>APPEND_JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, it should be folder and nlsLocalize will be ignored.
	 * @param typeFlag One of <code>APPEND_USER_CLASSPATH</code>, <code>APPEND_BOOT_CLASSPATH</code>, <code>PREPEND_BOOT_CLASSPATH</code>, or <code>APPEND_JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
	 * @param nlsLocalize The usual value should be <code>false</code>. Use <code>true</code> if should look through fragments to gather them all as described in this methods description.
	 *
