	 *    to the callback when it is created, and it must pass
	 *    on to the handler. That way it is know which callback
	 *    to call on the client.
	 * msgID - The id of the message for the callback. This is an
	 *    agreed upon id of the developers of the callback on both
	 *    sides.
	 * parms - Null if no parms, or an array of objects to send to the client vm. They
	 *    will be turned into proxies on the client vm. So the callback
	 *    will recieve an array of proxies to the values in the parms.
	 *    If any of the entries in the array is itself an array, a
	 *    proxy to the array will be created and sent. The array itself
	 *    will not be sent.

	 *    If an array entry should go across as an array of proxies and
	 *    not as one proxy to an array, then the entry needs to be an
	 *    instance of ICallbackHandler.TransmitableArray. This will flag
	 *    that it should transmit the entire entry as proxies. This should
	 *    be used sparingly, only if there isn't much data in the array and
	 *    all of the array would be used on the client. That way transmitting
	 *    the entire array will be faster than accessing individual components.
