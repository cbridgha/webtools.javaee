<title>Correcting cyclical dependencies after an EAR is imported</title>

<h1 class="topictitle1">Correcting cyclical dependencies after an EAR is imported</h1>
<div><p>You can resolve cyclical dependencies after an EAR is imported.</p>
<div class="section">A cyclical dependency between two or more modules in an enterprise
application most commonly occurs when projects are imported from outside the
workbench. When a cycle exists between two or more modules in an enterprise
application, the Javaâ„¢ builder cannot accurately compute the build order
of the projects. Full builds fail under these conditions, or require several
invocations.<p>Therefore, the best practice is to organize your projects or
modules into components. This allows your module dependencies to function
as a tree instead of a cycle diagram. This practice has the added benefit
of producing a better factored and layered application.</p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>Identify all the classes within the JAR files that have cyclical
dependencies, then move those classes into a common Java project
or JAR file.</span></li>
<li><span>Use the enterprise application editor to map utility JAR files
to the common projects.</span></li>
<li><span>Use the JAR dependency editor or properties page, for each module
of the JAR in the application, to set dependencies only to the JAR files that
are truly required.</span></li>
