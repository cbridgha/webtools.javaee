<h1 class="topictitle1">Importing an enterprise application EAR file</h1>
<div><p>Enterprise application projects are deployed into EAR files. You
can import an enterprise application project by importing it from a deployed
EAR file.</p>
<div class="section"> <p>You can also choose to import utility JAR files as utility Javaâ„¢ projects.
You can also use the wizard to change the new project names for the EAR file
and modules that will be imported.</p>
<p>To import an EAR file using the wizard:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the J2EE perspective, click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Import</span></span>. The Import window opens.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">EAR file</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Specify the following general options for the EAR import:</span> <ol type="a"><li><span><span class="uicontrol">EAR file</span>: Enter the full path for the
EAR file that you want to import. You can click <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> to
select the EAR file from the file system.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="uicontrol">EAR project</span>: type a name for the enterprise
application project that will be created when you import the EAR file.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="uicontrol">Target runtime</span>: Select the application
server that you want to target for your development. This selection affects
the runtime settings by modifying the class path entries for the project.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>, and complete the following steps:</span><ol type="a"><li><span>On the Enterprise Application Import page, select any utility
JAR files from the project that you want to import as utility projects.</span></li>
<li><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Module Root Location field</span>, specify
the root directory for all of the projects that will be imported or created
during import.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>On the EAR Module and Utility JAR Projects page of the wizard,
select the projects that you want to import with the EAR file. Also, you can
edit the new project name for each module and utility project to be imported.</span> <div class="tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> The selection buttons on this page can help you select
the projects to import when you are importing for partial EAR development.
For example, if you are importing to a workspace where some projects are attached
to a repository and other projects are in binary form, these buttons help
you make the proper selections for which projects to import:<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Select New</span>: Selects the projects that are currently
not in your workspace.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Select All</span>: Selects all projects for import.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Deselect All</span>: Clears all module and utility projects
for import.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span> to import the contents of the
EAR file.</span></li>
