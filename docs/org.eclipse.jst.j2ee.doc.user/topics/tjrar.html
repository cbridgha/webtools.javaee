<div><p>A connector is a J2EE standard extension mechanism for containers

<div class="section"> <p> A connector is a J2EE standard extension mechanism for containers
to provide connectivity to enterprise information systems (EISs). A connector
is specific to an EIS and consists of a resource adapter and application development
tools. A resource adapter is a system-level software driver that is used by
an EJB container or an application client to connect to an EIS. Connectors
comply with the J2EE Connector architecture (JCA).</p>
<div class="restriction"><span class="restrictiontitle">Restriction:</span> J2EE
1.2 specification level does not include connector capability.</div>
<p>To
create a new connector project:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the J2EE perspective, select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Connector Project</span></span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Name</span> field, type a name for the connector
project. To change the default <span class="uicontrol">Project location</span>, click
the <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> button to select a new location.</span> If
you specify a non-default project location that is already being used by another
project, the project creation will fail.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Show Advanced</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">JCA version</span> drop-down list, select
the specification version to which you want your connector project to adhere.</span> </li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Target server</span> drop-down list, select
the application server that you want to target for your development. This
selection affects the run time settings by modifying the class path entries
for the project.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Specify whether you want to add the new module to an enterprise
application (EAR) project.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">EAR project</span> combination box, type
a new project name or select an existing enterprise application project from
the drop-down list. Or, click the <span class="uicontrol">New</span> button to launch
the New Enterprise Application Project wizard.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you type
a new EAR project name, the EAR project will be created in the default location
with the lowest compatible J2EE version based on the version of the project
being created. If you want to specify a different version or a different location
for the enterprise application, you must use the New Enterprise Application
Project wizard.</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
