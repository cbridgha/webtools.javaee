<h1 class="topictitle1">Project Explorer view in the J2EE perspective</h1>
<div><p>While developing J2EE applications in the J2EE perspective, the
Project Explorer view is your main view of your J2EE projects and resources.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Project Explorer view</h4>The Project Explorer view provides
an integrated view of all project resources, including models of J2EE deployment
descriptors, Javaâ„¢ artifacts, resources, Web services, databases,
and dynamic Web project artifacts.<p>You should use this view to work with
your J2EE deployment descriptors and their content. You can easily view an
enterprise application project and see all of the modules associated with
it. </p>
<p>You can also filter what you see in the Project Explorer view to
hide projects, folders, or files that you don't want to see. To enable or
disable filters, click the <span class="uicontrol">Filters</span> button from the
drop-down menu at the top right corner of the view. For more information,
see <a href="cjviewfilters.html" title="You can filter the Project Explorer view to hide projects, folders, or files that you don't want to see.">Filters in the Project Explorer view</a>.</p>
<p>The following image shows the Project Explorer view with the <span class="uicontrol">Group
projects by type</span> option selected in the toolbar:<br /><img src="../images/ProjectExplorer.gif" alt="Screen capture of the Project Explorer view" /><br /></p>

<dd>Shows any non-J2EE module projects, such as Java projects. These Java projects
can be any of the following types: <ul><li>Utility projects for existing Enterprise Application projects in your
workspace</li>
<li>EJB Client JAR Projects, which include the client interface classes (remote,
home, local, or local home interfaces) for beans in EJB projects</li>
<li>Java projects
that are in your workspace but unrelated to your J2EE development</li>
