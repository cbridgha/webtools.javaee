<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding a facet to a J2EE project</h1>
<div><div>This topic explains how to add a facet to an existing project in
your workspace.</div><div class="section">Facets define characteristics and requirements for projects. When
you add a facet to a project, that project is configured to perform a certain
task, fulfill certain requirements, or have certain characteristics. For example,
the EAR facet sets up a project to function as an enterprise application by
adding a deployment descriptor and setting up the project's classpath.<p>New
projects generally have facets added to them when they are created. To add
another facet to a project that already exists, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Project Explorer view, right-click the project and then
click <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Properties window, click <span class="uicontrol">Project Facets</span>.</span> The Project Facets page lists the facets in the project. </li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Add/Remove Project Facets</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Add/Remove Project Facets window, select the check boxes
next to the facets you want this project to have and select a version number
for each facet.</span> You can also choose a preset combination of facets
from the <span class="uicontrol">Presets</span> list, and you can find out more about
the requirements for each facet by right-clicking the facet name and then
clicking <span class="uicontrol">Show Constraints</span>.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to limit the project so it will be compatible with
one or more runtimes, click the <span class="uicontrol">Show Runtimes</span> button
and select the runtimes that you want the project to be compatible with.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</span></li>
