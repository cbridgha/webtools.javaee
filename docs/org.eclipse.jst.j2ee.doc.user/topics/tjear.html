<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating an enterprise application project</h1>
<div><div class="section"><p>Enterprise application projects contain references to the resources
needed for enterprise applications and can contain a combination of Web modules,
JAR files, connector modules, EJB modules, and application client modules.
An enterprise application project is deployed in the form of an EAR file,
and is therefore sometimes referred to as an EAR project. The modules in an
enterprise application project are mapped to other J2EE projects. The mapping
information is stored in metadata files within the enterprise application
project. The metadata files are used for exporting the project to an EAR file
and for running the project on the server.</p>
<p>When you create an enterprise
application project, it is recommended that you do not give it a name that
contains double-byte character set (DBCS) characters.</p>
<p>To
create a J2EE enterprise application project:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the J2EE perspective, select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Application Project</span></span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Name</span> field, type a name for the new
enterprise application project. To change the default <span class="uicontrol">Project location</span>,
click the <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> button to select a new location.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Show Advanced</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Target runtime</span> drop-down list, select
the application server that you want to target for your development. </span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Module Version</span> list, specify the
J2EE specification level that you want to use for this enterprise application.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>On the EAR Modules page of the wizard, select the existing modules
that you want to add to the new enterprise application project. Click the <span class="uicontrol">New
Module</span> button to open another wizard where you can create new
modules for this enterprise application. In the New Module wizard, if you
select the <span class="uicontrol">Create default module projects</span> check box,
you can choose to create default versions of the following modules which will
be compatible with the enterprise application J2EE version:</span><ul><li>Application client project</li>
<li>EJB project</li>
<li>Web project</li>
<li>Connector project</li>
</ul>
 The wizard provides default project names for the modules, but you can
specify different project names. The default modules that are created will
have the same server target as the new enterprise application.<p>If you clear
the <span class="uicontrol">Create default module projects</span> check box, you can
select a single module type and proceed with the proper wizard for that project
type.</p>
<p>If you create new modules at this time, they are added to the
list of available modules in the New Enterprise Application Project wizard,
if the module versions are compatible with the new enterprise application
you are creating.</p>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
