<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating an enterprise application project</h1>
<div><div class="section"><p>Enterprise application projects contain references to the resources
needed for enterprise applications and can contain a combination of Web modules,
JAR files, connector modules, EJB modules, and application client modules.
An enterprise application project is deployed in the form of an EAR file,
and is therefore sometimes referred to as an EAR project. The modules in an
enterprise application project are mapped to other J2EE projects. The mapping
information is stored in metadata files within the enterprise application
project. The metadata files are used for exporting the project to an EAR file
and for running the project on the server.</p>
<p>Like the other types of projects,
enterprise application projects can contain one or more project facets, which
represent units of functionality in the project. To be deployed as an EAR
file, the new project must have the EAR facet. Depending on what you want
to use the project for, you may want to enable other facets for the project.</p>
<p>When you create an enterprise
application project, it is recommended that you do not give it a name that
contains double-byte character set (DBCS) characters.</p>
<p>To
create a J2EE enterprise application project:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the J2EE perspective, click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Application Project</span></span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Name</span> field, type a name for the new
project. </span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>To change the default project location, clear the <span class="uicontrol">Use
default</span> check box under <span class="uicontrol">Project contents</span> and
select a new location with the <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> button.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select the check boxes next to the facets you want this project
to have and select a version number for each facet. </span> You can also
choose a preset combination of facets from the <span class="uicontrol">Presets</span> list,
and you can also find out more about the requirements for each facet by right-clicking
the facet name and then clicking <span class="uicontrol">Show Constraints</span>.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to limit your project so it will be compatible with
one or more runtimes, click the <span class="uicontrol">Show Runtimes</span> button
and select the runtimes that you want the project to be compatible with.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>On the J2EE Modules to Add to the EAR page of the wizard, select
the existing modules that you want to add to the new enterprise application
project. </span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>You can also create new modules to add to the project:</span><ol type="a"><li class="substepexpand"><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">New Module</span> button.</span></li>
<li class="substepexpand"><span>If you want to create one module, clear the <span class="uicontrol">Create
default modules</span> check box, select the type of module you want
to create, click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span> and follow the New Project wizard
for that type of project.</span></li>
<li class="substepexpand"><span>If you want to create more than one module, select the <span class="uicontrol">Create
default modules</span> check box, select the check boxes for each type
of project you want to create, and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>. </span> You can enter a name for each module. Each of these modules will have
the default settings for that type of project and they will have the same
server target as the new enterprise application.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
