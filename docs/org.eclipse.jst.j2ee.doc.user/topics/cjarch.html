<h1 class="topictitle1">J2EE architecture</h1>
<div><p>The Javaâ„¢ 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) provides
a standard for developing multitier, enterprise services.</p>
<p>The economy and technology of today have intensified the need for faster,
more efficient, and larger-scale information management solutions. The J2EE
specification satisfies these challenges by providing a programming model
that improves development productivity, standardizes the platform for hosting
enterprise applications, and ensures portability of developed applications
with an extensive test suite.</p>
<p>J2EE architecture supports component-based development of multi-tier enterprise
applications. A J2EE application system typically includes the following tiers:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Client tier</strong>: In the client tier, Web components, such as Servlets
and JavaServer Pages (JSPs), or standalone Java applications provide a dynamic
interface to the middle tier.</li>
<li><strong>Middle tier</strong>: In the server tier, or middle tier, enterprise beans
and Web Services encapsulate reusable, distributable business logic for the
application. These server-tier components are contained on a J2EE Application
Server, which provides the platform for these components to perform actions
and store data.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise data tier</strong>: In the data tier, the enterprise's data is
stored and persisted, typically in a relational database.</li>
</ul>
<p>J2EE applications are comprised of components, containers, and services.
Components are application-level components. Web components, such as Servlets
and JSPs, provide dynamic responses to requests from a Web page. EJB components
contain server-side business logic for enterprise applications. Web and EJB
component containers host services that support Web and EJB modules.</p>
