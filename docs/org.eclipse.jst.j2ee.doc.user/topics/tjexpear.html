<h1 class="topictitle1">Exporting an enterprise application into an EAR file</h1>
<div><p>Enterprise applications are deployed in the form of an EAR file.
Use the Export wizard to export an enterprise application project into an
EAR file for deployment.</p>
<div class="section"> <p>To export an enterprise application project into an EAR file:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Project Explorer view of the J2EE perspective, right-click
the project that you want to export.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Export</span> from the pop-up menu. The Export
wizard opens.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Under <span class="uicontrol">Select an export destination</span>, click <span class="uicontrol">EAR
file</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">EAR Application</span> list, select the
project to export.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Destination</span> field, enter the full
path and EAR file name where you want to export the enterprise application
project that is selected in the <span class="uicontrol">EAR application</span> field.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>To export source files, select the <span class="uicontrol">Export
source files</span> check box.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>If you are exporting to an existing EAR file
and you do not want to be warned about overwriting it, select <span class="uicontrol">Overwrite
existing files without warning</span></span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>Select <span class="uicontrol">Include project build paths
and meta-data files</span>.</span> This allows you to preserve the
original names of projects included in or referenced by the application project,
for re-importing the EAR in another workspace. </li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section">The wizard exports the contents of the EAR project to the specified
EAR file. Additionally, for each project that corresponds to a module or utility
JAR in the application, the project contents are exported into a nested module
or JAR file in the EAR file. If any unsaved changes exist on any of the files
in any of the referenced projects, you are prompted to save these files prior
to export.</div>
