<h1 class="topictitle1">Cyclical dependencies between J2EE modules</h1>
<div><p>A cyclical dependency between two or more modules in an enterprise application
most commonly occurs when projects are imported from outside the Workbench.
When a cycle exists between two or more modules in an enterprise application,
the Javaâ„¢ builder
cannot accurately compute the build order of the projects. Full builds fail
under these conditions, or require several invocations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best practice is to componentize your projects or modules.
This allows you to have your module dependencies function as a tree instead
of a cycle diagram. This practice has the added benefit of producing a better
factored and layered application.</p>
